So, censors that i want:
 1. Light in the darkness
 2. Lines all over the screen, that the player can drag. 
 3. bouncing bubbles, revealing the picture after you click on them
 4. Fracturing, that fractures a complete picture into smaller fragments, with the cracks being the original picture. Or a grid, with offset grid points, that'd be a cool one too. Mosaic style. 
 5. The other defragmenting puzzle that the other person made
 8. Copies memory puzzle
10. Tetris
 12. Fruit Ninja
14. Minesweeper
15. A small casino, with blackjack, roulette, and perhaps some more games that come to mind, revealing more and more as the money stack grows.
